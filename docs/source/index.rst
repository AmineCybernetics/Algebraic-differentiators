Welcome to the documentation of AlgDiff
=======================================

**AlgDiff** is a Python class that provides all necessary tools for the
design, analysis, and discretization of algebraic differentiators. An
interface to Matlab is also provided. This implementation was released
as part of the survey `[1] <#1>`__.   A tutorial for algebraic differentiators and this package can be found in `[6] <#6>`__.
Check out :ref:`installation` for informations regarding the installation. :ref:`examples` are are also provided.

This code has been created for research purposes at the `Chair of
Systems Theory and Control
Engineering <https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/chair/rudolph.html>`__ of
Saarland University, Germany. We apply algebraic differentiators to
solve different problems related to control theory and signal
processing: Parameter estimation, feedback control, fault detection and
fault tolerant control, model-free control â€¦
